First, use `const` to explicitly define the date. The key is that we need to generate a data type that is very similar and meets the requirements. The type refers to latitude + longitude + the values we need. At line 55, AQI is used. In the following series of operations, we need to control the radius size of this scatter plot. The solution is to directly divide the radius size (AQI) value by 5.

The JSON file I packaged in the help folder is a hierarchical file of geographic data. The data inside was obtained from a website, whose URL is https://echarts.apache.org/examples/zh/editor.html?c=effectScatter-bmap. However, since this website is free, there is some inaccuracy in precision, but the effect is still quite good.

In the second chart, the redder it is, the worse the situation. I didn't write an option separately but designed one myself. I also used an additional calendar to represent the date, which is the range. The most important part is still this data. I first converted the data into year and month, then passed the AQI value into it, i.e., first obtained its value from the JSON file, and then placed it into AQI.
